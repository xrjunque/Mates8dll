# Mates8dll
# Mates8 calculator .Net Library
# Features:
# » Basic arithmetic and polynomial operations (-,+,*,/,^,%), including GCD
# » finds polynomials roots, of real or complex coefficients,
# » does multivariable polynomial division,
# » Lagrangian interpolation and
# » basic matrix operations (-,+,*,/,^).
# » May obtain the inverse matrix, 
# » cofactor,
# » adjoint,
# » transpose matrix,
# » echelon form,
# » Jordan form,
# » eigenvalues,
# » eigenvectors, and
# » the determinant of an invertible matrix of real, complex, polynomial or expression entries.
# » Performs derivatives using Euler's notation, e.g.: Dx(sin(x));
# » Jacobian;
# » approximates the exponential matrix (e.g. exp(1,cos(x)|0,1)=(2.718..,2.718...*cos(x)|0,2.718...))
# » Resolves linear, when compatible and determinate or indeterminate,
# » as non linear system of equations.
# » Also, is capable of bounded definite integrals,
# » inmediate, 
# » trigonometric or
# » partial fractions integration -quotients of polynomials integration- and
# » integration by parts.
# » Solve some ordinary first order differential equations with or without specifying the initial condition.
# » Approximates first order diff. eqs. by Euler's method specifying the initial condition.
